In this practice, you are asked to begin writing an application that will track statistics in a soccer league. 
You are told what basics objects must be modeled, but must figure out the implementation details yourself.
See activity guide

Classes:
    Player class: Each player has a name
    Team class: Each team has a name. A team also contains a roster of its players
    Goal class: The application must keep track of goals scored. A goal can be described by the team who scored it, the player who scored it, and the time it was scored it (Represent time as a double)
    Game class: The application must keep track of games played. A game can be described by its home team, its away team, and each goal that may have been scored.
